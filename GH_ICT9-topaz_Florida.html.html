			<td class="bg-light text-danger">There are several reasons why it's important to store flammable liquids safely. First, by keeping these substances away from potential sources of fire, we can reduce the risk of a serious blaze breaking out. Second, using these substances in a responsible way can help prevent them from adding fuel to any existing fires. Finally, keeping flammable liquids in a cool, dry place will also help them last longer and reduce the chances of them spontaneously combusting.</td>
